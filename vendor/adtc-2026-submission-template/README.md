### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `team_id` | ✅ | Your unique team ID as registered on the ADTF portal |
| `domain` | ✅ | Your challenge track. One of: `math_scientific_reasoning`, `healthcare_medical`, `agriculture`, `creative_writing`, `coding_assistants`, `corporate_enterprise`, `autonomous_ai_agents` |
| `language_scope` | ✅ | Array of BCP-47 language codes. Must include at least one. |
| `african_alpha_claim` | ✅ | `true` only if claiming the African Use Case Bonus |
| `budget_laptop_claim` | ✅ | Must be `true` — all submissions target the 8 GB RAM laptop profile |
| `submitter.name` | ✅ | Full name of the team member submitting the run |
| `submitter.email` | ✅ | Valid email address linked to the registered team |
| `submitter.github_handle` | ✅ | Verifiable GitHub username |
| `cross_disciplinary_pairing.discipline` | ✅ | The deep-tech discipline your model serves |
| `cross_disciplinary_pairing.load_bearing` | ✅ | `true` if the pairing is integral to the submission, not cosmetic |
| `test_prompts` | ✅ | **Exactly 2 prompts** in your chosen domain. Organizers will add 2 hidden prompts to test for overfitting. |
| `model.runtime` | ✅ | Must be `llama.cpp`. No other runtime is accepted. |
| `model.quantization` | ✅ | Must be a GGUF quantization format (e.g. `GGUF Q4_K_M`, `GGUF Q5_K_M`) |
| `model.parameters_estimate` | ✅ | Approximate parameter count (e.g. `135M`, `1.1B`, `7B`) |
| `model.packaging` | ✅ | How the model is packaged. One of: `docker_image`, `docker_build_from_repo`, `binary_bundle` |
| `_runtime.model_path` | ✅ | Relative path from repo root to your `.gguf` file (e.g. `model/my-model.gguf`) |

## 📥 download_model.sh

This script **must** download your model weight file to the `model/` directory.

Rules:
- Must be idempotent — safe to run multiple times without re-downloading.
- Must work without any credentials — your weights must be publicly accessible.
- The downloaded file path must exactly match `_runtime.model_path` in `metadata.json`.

Recommended hosting options for your weights:
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) — public model repos (free, best for GGUF files)
- GitHub Release Assets — attach the `.gguf` file to a GitHub Release
- Any stable public URL (GCS public bucket, S3 public object, etc.)

## 📄 REPORT.md

Your technical writeup. Judges and the LLM-based audit system will read this to understand your submission. Cover:

1. **Problem** — What problem are you solving? Who is the target user in an African context?
2. **Design Decisions** — What model did you start from? Why that quantization level? What alternatives did you evaluate?
3. **Constraints** — What hardware, connectivity, or data constraints shaped your approach?
4. **Benchmarks** — What inference speed and memory numbers did you observe on your development machine?

Keep it factual and specific. One to three pages is ideal.

## 🧪 Local Testing

The ADTC profiler is open source. Install it directly from the official repository:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/Africa-Deep-Tech-Foundation/adtc-profiler.git"
```

Then run a local smoke test before submitting:

```bash
# 1. Download your weights
bash download_model.sh

# 2. Run the profiler in participant mode
adtc-profiler run \
  --submission . \
  --mode participant \
  --output submission.json \
  --skip-accuracy

# 3. Review your report
cat submission.json
```

A valid run produces a `submission.json` with `"measured_on": "participant_laptop"`.

The profiler source code, including the thermal monitoring logic and scoring formulas, is publicly readable at:
[github.com/Africa-Deep-Tech-Foundation/adtc-profiler](https://github.com/Africa-Deep-Tech-Foundation/adtc-profiler)

## ⚠️ Rules

1. **Public repository required.** Your repository must be public at the time of evaluation.
2. **No model weights in git.** Add `*.gguf` and `model/` to your `.gitignore`. The evaluator downloads weights fresh via `download_model.sh`.
3. **100% offline during evaluation.** Your model must run with zero external network dependencies during our testing window. `download_model.sh` runs before the profiler starts, but once profiling begins, no outbound requests are permitted.
4. **llama.cpp only.** All models must use GGUF weights and run through `llama.cpp`. No other runtime is supported by our evaluation framework.
5. **8 GB RAM limit.** Your model must run within the standard laptop profile (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, integrated GPU only). Out-of-memory errors during evaluation result in automatic disqualification.
6. **No size restriction.** There is no parameter count or file size cap — but the 8 GB RAM constraint is strict. Plan your quantization level accordingly.
7. **Two test prompts required.** Your `metadata.json` must include exactly 2 prompts in the `test_prompts` array. Organizers will generate 2 additional hidden prompts within your domain. All 4 are used for scoring.
